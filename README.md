Private Image Viewer.

Welcome to the Private Image Viewer (PiV) which is designed to allow you to keep and view encrypted images and videos on your computer in a safe and private manner. Even in countries where you must give your password to the authorities it remains safe. You can give any password that you have not used and the program will run as normal. Except your encrypted files will not be viewable.
